<p>This Software NOT encourage piracy, which is an act UNLAWFUL, as well as being a lack of respect towards those who dedicate time and effort to the development of applications.

I do not assume liability for incorrect use, that is NOT dedicated to a vision for informational or educational study. With this I can tell you that I dedicate myself to NOT piracy in any way, I care only to share and study all forms of system and evasion.

I disagree, in any form, software piracy and are NOT responsible for a eventale inappropriate or illegal use.

By using these program you automatically agree to the written agreement above, and thus the responsibility regarding whatever you are affected by any EULAs is with YOU and YOU only.

Thanks to: QAD, xinso, Hotbird64, nonosense, Nosferati87, Mikmik38, Cynecx, heldigard, Daz, Alphawaves, Nummer for the various source codes and the work!

Thanks to all the people who have supported the development in all its forms:</p>
